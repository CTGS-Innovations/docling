## Performance Architecture

### Aho-Corasick Algorithm
- **Linear performance scaling** with number of patterns
- **Sub-millisecond classification** times
- **Modular pattern loading** from YAML files
- **Memory efficient** shared automaton

### Layered Classification System
1. **Layer 1-2**: File metadata and document structure (free/fast)
2. **Layer 3**: Domain + document type classification (Aho-Corasick)
3. **Layer 4-5**: Entity extraction and deep domain analysis (conditional)

Early termination prevents unnecessary processing when confidence is sufficient.

## Usage for Scout Platform

### Document Processing Flow
1. **Input**: Document content from any source
2. **Layer 3 Classification**: 
   - Domain classification → Routes to SaaS vertical specialist
   - Document type classification → Determines processing pipeline
3. **Intelligence Extraction**: Domain-specific entrepreneurial intelligence
4. **AI Agent Routing**: Route to appropriate MVP development teams

### Example Classifications
```yaml
# OSHA Safety Document
domains: 
  safety: 42.9%
  compliance: 28.6%
document_types:
  regulation: 50.0%
  
# Startup Pitch Deck  
domains:
  startup_venture: 78.5%
  capital_markets: 21.5%
document_types:
  pitch_deck: 85.2%
  
# User Pain Point Discussion
domains:
  pain_points: 65.3%
  social_media: 34.7%
document_types:
  pain_point_discussion: 73.1%
```

## Expansion Guidelines

### Adding New Domains
1. Create new YAML file in `domains/` directory
2. Follow naming convention: `{domain_name}.yaml`
3. Include minimum 3-5 categories per domain
4. Weight keywords appropriately (1.0-4.0 scale)
5. Test with representative content samples

### Adding New Document Types
1. Create new YAML file in `document_types/` directory  
2. Include minimum 5-10 document types per vertical
3. Focus on high-volume, business-critical document types
4. Ensure patterns are distinctive and non-overlapping

### Performance Considerations
- Keep keyword lists focused and relevant
- Use appropriate weights (higher = more definitive)
- Test pattern effectiveness with real content
- Monitor classification confidence scores
- Optimize for Scout's target <50ms classification time

## Future Enhancements

### Potential New Domains
- **Real Estate** - Property, construction, development
- **Energy** - Renewable, oil/gas, utilities
- **Media/Entertainment** - Content, streaming, gaming
- **Transportation** - Logistics, automotive, aviation
- **Government** - Public sector, municipal services

### Advanced Features
- **Dynamic pattern learning** from successful classifications
- **Confidence threshold optimization** per domain
- **Multi-language support** for global market intelligence
- **Real-time pattern updates** for emerging trends
