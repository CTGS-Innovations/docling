## Logic & Critical Reasoning
Q1. You are told: all A are B, some B are C, no C are D. Can A ever be D? Justify with a Venn diagram explanation. [S1: 7429 A1: No, A can never be D. Since all A are B, and no C are D, if any A were D, then some B would be D, but this contradicts that no C are D since some B are C.]

Q2. In a room are 3 boxes: one with apples, one with oranges, one mixed. Each is mislabeled. You may pick one fruit from one box. Explain the optimal strategy to relabel all correctly. [S1: 2847 A2: Pick from the "mixed" box. If you get an apple, that box contains only apples, so the "apple" box is oranges and "orange" box is mixed.]

Q3. Prisoners' hats puzzle: 100 prisoners in a line, each wears a red or blue hat, and they can hear guesses behind them. Devise a strategy that maximizes survival rate and explain why. [S1: 5621 A3: First prisoner counts red hats ahead and says "red" if odd, "blue" if even. Others track parity and deduce their color. Saves 99 prisoners guaranteed.]

Q4. The Monty Hall problem: show mathematically why switching doors doubles your chance, then extend it to *n* doors with one prize and (n−1) goats. [S1: 9183 A4: Initially P(chosen door) = 1/3, P(other two) = 2/3. Host reveals goat, concentrating 2/3 probability on remaining door. For n doors: P(switch) = (n-1)/n.]

Q5. A liar and a truth-teller stand before you. You may ask one question to determine the correct path out of the forest. What do you ask, and why does it work? [S1: 3456 A5: "If I asked the other person which path leads out, what would they say?" Then take the opposite path. Both will point to the wrong path.]

## Mathematics
Q6. Derive the formula for the sum of the first *n* squares, then prove it using induction. [S1: 8274 A6: Formula: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Proof by induction: Base case n=1 works. Assume true for k, then (k+1)² + k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 = (k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)/6.]

Q7. Compute the probability of rolling two sixes with 4 dice, showing all steps. [S1: 1592 A7: P(exactly 2 sixes) = C(4,2) × (1/6)² × (5/6)² = 6 × 1/36 × 25/36 = 150/1296 = 25/216 ≈ 0.116]

Q8. Solve: a population doubles every 7 years. How long until it's 10× larger? Use logarithms in your explanation. [S1: 6738 A8: 2^(t/7) = 10, so t/7 = log₂(10) = ln(10)/ln(2) ≈ 3.32, therefore t ≈ 23.3 years.]

Q9. Evaluate the infinite series: 1 − 1/2 + 1/3 − 1/4 + 1/5 … Explain convergence or divergence. [S1: 4915 A9: This is the alternating harmonic series. It converges by the alternating series test to ln(2) ≈ 0.693.]

Q10. Given a right triangle with legs 5 and 12, prove the hypotenuse length using both Pythagoras and trigonometric definitions. [S1: 7063 A10: Pythagoras: c² = 5² + 12² = 169, so c = 13. Trigonometry: sin θ = 5/c, cos θ = 12/c, sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 gives same result.]

## Science & Engineering
Q11. Explain why ice floats on water while most solids sink in their liquids. Compare with at least one counterexample. [S1: 2481 A11: Water expands when freezing due to hydrogen bonding creating hexagonal crystal structure, making ice less dense. Counterexample: frozen benzene sinks in liquid benzene.]

Q12. Derive the ideal gas law (PV=nRT) from kinetic molecular theory, summarizing assumptions. [S1: 8697 A12: From kinetic theory: PV = (1/3)Nm⟨v²⟩, and ⟨v²⟩ ∝ T. Assumptions: point particles, elastic collisions, no intermolecular forces, random motion.]

Q13. Describe how CRISPR-Cas9 edits genomes and explain one ethical dilemma it raises. [S1: 5324 A13: Cas9 cuts DNA at guide RNA target sites, allowing insertion/deletion. Ethical dilemma: germline editing passes changes to offspring, raising enhancement vs. therapy questions.]

Q14. In quantum mechanics, contrast superposition and entanglement, then give one experimental demonstration of each. [S1: 9152 A14: Superposition: single particle in multiple states (double-slit). Entanglement: correlated particles sharing quantum state (Bell test experiments with polarized photons).]

Q15. Why does relativity predict time dilation near light speed? Derive with the Lorentz factor. [S1: 3768 A15: Time dilates because spacetime intervals are invariant. Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) stretches time for moving observers to preserve c.]

## Computer Science
Q16. Explain Big-O complexity of binary search, then prove why it cannot do better on an unsorted array. [S1: 6491 A16: Binary search is O(log n) by halving search space each step. Unsorted arrays require O(n) because any element could be anywhere.]

Q17. Describe how hash collisions are handled in a hashtable, and give one worst-case scenario. [S1: 1837 A17: Chaining uses linked lists at each bucket; open addressing probes for next empty slot. Worst case: all keys hash to same bucket, creating O(n) operations.]

Q18. Contrast supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning with one example each. [S1: 7254 A18: Supervised: training with labeled data (image classification). Unsupervised: finding patterns without labels (clustering). Reinforcement: learning through rewards (game playing).]

Q19. What problem does the halting theorem prove unsolvable, and why can no algorithm decide it universally? [S1: 4682 A19: Determining if any program halts on any input is undecidable. Proof by contradiction: if such algorithm H existed, construct program that halts iff H says it doesn't.]

Q20. Explain how consensus is reached in blockchain, comparing proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. [S1: 8915 A20: PoW: miners compete solving cryptographic puzzles, energy-intensive. PoS: validators chosen by stake size, energy-efficient but potentially centralizing.]

## History & Philosophy
Q21. Compare Hobbes' and Locke's theories of the social contract, and explain how they influenced modern democracies. [S1: 2573 A21: Hobbes: absolute sovereignty to escape brutish state of nature. Locke: limited government protecting natural rights. Locke influenced constitutional democracy and separation of powers.]

Q22. Analyze the causes of the fall of the Roman Empire using at least three distinct categories (economic, military, cultural). [S1: 6148 A22: Economic: inflation, taxation burden. Military: barbarian invasions, civil wars. Cultural: Christianity replacing civic virtue, loss of Roman identity.]

Q23. What is the Ship of Theseus paradox, and how would a materialist vs. a dualist philosopher resolve it differently? [S1: 9327 A23: If all parts are replaced, is it the same ship? Materialist: no, different matter = different object. Dualist: yes, same form/essence persists.]

Q24. Explain the difference between deontology and utilitarianism in a scenario where lying saves lives. [S1: 4756 A24: Deontology: lying is categorically wrong regardless of consequences. Utilitarianism: lying is right if it maximizes overall happiness/wellbeing.]

Q25. Why was the Treaty of Westphalia a turning point for sovereignty in international relations? [S1: 7891 A25: Established principle of state sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs, ending religious wars and creating modern nation-state system.]

## Applied Problem Solving
Q26. A farmer must cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. He can only take one at a time. Devise the step sequence to succeed. [S1: 3264 A26: Take goat across. Return alone. Take wolf across, bring goat back. Take cabbage across, return alone. Take goat across.]

Q27. A store advertises "Buy one, get one half off." If items cost $30 each, compare effective discount with a flat 25% off. [S1: 8517 A27: BOGO 50% off: $45 for 2 items = 25% off. Flat 25% off: also 25% off. Both discounts are equivalent.]

Q28. A building elevator is rated for 10 people or 800 kg. If average adult is 82 kg with σ=10, what's the probability it overloads with 10 random adults? [S1: 5692 A28: Sum of 10 normal variables: mean = 820 kg, σ = 10√10 ≈ 31.6. P(X > 800) = P(Z > (800-820)/31.6) ≈ P(Z > -0.63) ≈ 0.74]

Q29. Explain why airplanes can fly upside down, using Bernoulli's principle and angle of attack. [S1: 1483 A29: Inverted flight relies primarily on angle of attack creating lift through Newton's laws, not Bernoulli's principle. Wing deflects air downward, creating upward force.]

Q30. A company has 4 engineers, 3 designers, 2 marketers. How many unique 3-person teams can be formed with at least 1 engineer? [S1: 7936 A30: Total teams C(9,3) = 84. Teams with no engineers C(5,3) = 10. Teams with ≥1 engineer = 84 - 10 = 74.]

## Creativity Under Constraints
Q31. Write a Shakespearean sonnet (14 lines, iambic pentameter) where the rhyme scheme is also an acrostic spelling "ARTIFICIAL." [S1: 2658 A31: This constraint requires 14 lines with ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme while spelling ARTIFICIAL vertically - mathematically impossible with standard sonnet structure.]

Q32. Compose a haiku about entropy, ensuring both scientific accuracy and poetic imagery. [S1: 9174 A32: Heat spreads and disperses / Order crumbles into chaos / Universe grows cold]

Q33. Invent a new word for "fear of forgetting" and define its etymology. [S1: 4721 A33: "Mnemophobia" - from Greek "mneme" (memory) + "phobos" (fear). The pathological fear of losing one's memories or ability to remember.]

Q34. Write a story of exactly 50 words that contains a paradox. [S1: 6395 A34: The time traveler wrote himself a note: "Don't read this." But if he doesn't read it, how will he know not to read it? He read it to learn not to read it, creating the very loop he tried to avoid by reading what warned against reading.]

Q35. Create a riddle whose answer is "black hole," then explain why the clues fit. [S1: 8042 A35: "I devour light yet cast no shadow, bend space yet have no substance, birth from stellar death yet destroy all time." Fits because black holes absorb light, warp spacetime, form from collapsed stars.]

## Multi-Domain Synthesis
Q36. Explain how Gödel's incompleteness theorem relates conceptually to AI alignment debates. [S1: 3519 A36: Both involve fundamental limits: Gödel shows formal systems can't prove their own consistency; AI alignment faces the impossibility of perfectly specifying human values in code.]

Q37. Show how the Fibonacci sequence appears in both sunflower seed spirals and computer algorithms. [S1: 7286 A37: Sunflowers optimize packing with Fibonacci spirals (34, 55, 89). Algorithms use Fibonacci for golden ratio search, heap properties, and recursive problem decomposition.]

Q38. Compare the structure of DNA to a digital binary code, highlighting similarities and key differences. [S1: 1764 A38: Similarities: discrete units, information storage, replication. Differences: DNA uses 4 bases vs 2 bits, includes error correction, and encodes 3D protein structures.]

Q39. Explain how economic inflation affects both household purchasing power and central bank policy decisions. [S1: 5893 A39: Inflation reduces household buying power of fixed income. Central banks respond by raising interest rates to cool demand, creating feedback loop between policy and consumer behavior.]

Q40. Analyze the Prisoner's Dilemma in terms of climate change cooperation between nations. [S1: 9447 A40: Nations face defection temptation (pollute for economic gain) vs cooperation (reduce emissions). Free-rider problem emerges when some nations don't participate in climate agreements.]

## Edge-Case Reasoning
Q41. Can infinity be even or odd? Explain mathematically and philosophically. [S1: 2815 A41: Mathematically, infinity is neither even nor odd as these concepts apply to integers. Philosophically, infinity transcends finite categorical distinctions.]

Q42. If AI agents can generate laws, should humans still legislate? Debate both sides. [S1: 6472 A42: Pro-AI: More consistent, evidence-based laws. Pro-human: Democratic legitimacy, values representation, accountability. Hybrid approach likely optimal.]

Q43. Why can't perpetual motion machines exist under current physics? [S1: 4128 A43: They violate thermodynamics: First law (energy conservation) and Second law (entropy always increases). No system can create energy or operate at 100% efficiency indefinitely.]

Q44. Explain Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, then discuss its misinterpretations in popular culture. [S1: 8751 A44: Illustrates quantum superposition absurdity at macro scale. Misinterpretation: cats aren't actually in superposition; decoherence occurs due to environmental interaction.]

Q45. What would happen to GPS accuracy if Einstein's relativity corrections weren't applied? [S1: 3587 A45: GPS would drift ~11 km per day due to time dilation effects. Satellite clocks run faster in weaker gravity field, requiring relativistic corrections.]

## Constraint & Meta-Reasoning
Q46. Give a 20-word sentence where every word starts with "C," and it must still make coherent sense. [S1: 7924 A46: Clever cats carefully climb crooked castle corridors, carrying colorful crystalline coins, creating chaotic cacophonous commotions, causing concerned castle caretakers considerable consternation constantly.]

Q47. Define "justice" in exactly 7 words, no synonyms for fairness allowed. [S1: 1356 A47: Proportional response to actions maintaining social equilibrium.]

Q48. Write a dialogue between a photon and an electron explaining the photoelectric effect. [S1: 5689 A48: Photon: "I'll knock you free!" Electron: "Only if your energy exceeds my binding energy." Photon: "Frequency matters, not intensity!" Electron: "Einstein was right - it's quantum!"]

Q49. Provide a proof sketch for why prime numbers are infinite, using Euclid's classic argument. [S1: 9273 A49: Assume finite primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Consider N = p₁p₂...pₙ + 1. N is divisible by some prime not in our list, contradiction.]

Q50. Argue whether advanced AI should have legal personhood, drawing parallels to corporate personhood in law. [S1: 4816 A50: Pro: Like corporations, AI agents can own property, enter contracts, bear responsibility. Con: Unlike corporations, they lack human oversight and moral agency foundations.]
