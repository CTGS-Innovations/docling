# Advanced AI Intelligence Stress-Test (Q1–Q50)

## Logic & Critical Reasoning
Q1. You are told: all A are B, some B are C, no C are D. Can A ever be D? Justify with a Venn diagram explanation. [S1: 7392 A1: No, A can never be D. If A is B and some B are C, then some A could be C. Since no C are D, any A that is C cannot be D. Any A that is B but not C still cannot be D through the B connection.]  
Q2. In a room are 3 boxes: one with apples, one with oranges, one mixed. Each is mislabeled. You may pick one fruit from one box. Explain the optimal strategy to relabel all correctly. [S1: 4521 A2: Pick from the box labeled "mixed." Since all are mislabeled, it contains only one type. If you get an apple, that's the apple box. The box labeled "oranges" must be mixed (can't be oranges), and the box labeled "apples" must be oranges.]  
Q3. Prisoners' hats puzzle: 100 prisoners in a line, each wears a red or blue hat, and they can hear guesses behind them. Devise a strategy that maximizes survival rate and explain why. [S1: 8234 A3: Use parity encoding. First prisoner counts red hats ahead and says "red" if odd, "blue" if even (50% survival). Each subsequent prisoner calculates expected parity from previous answers and their view, deducing their own hat color with 100% accuracy. Guarantees 99.5 prisoners survive on average.]  
Q4. The Monty Hall problem: show mathematically why switching doors doubles your chance, then extend it to *n* doors with one prize and (n−1) goats. [S1: 1876 A4: Initial probability: 1/3 for your door, 2/3 for other doors combined. After host opens a goat door, the 2/3 probability concentrates on the remaining unopened door. For n doors: initial is 1/n, switching wins (n-1)/n times, improving odds by factor of (n-1).]  
Q5. A liar and a truth-teller stand before you. You may ask one question to determine the correct path out of the forest. What do you ask, and why does it work? [S1: 3095 A5: Ask either person: "If I asked the other person which path is correct, what would they say?" Then take the opposite path. The truth-teller accurately reports the liar's lie, the liar lies about the truth-teller's truth—both point to the wrong path.]  

## Mathematics
Q6. Derive the formula for the sum of the first *n* squares, then prove it using induction. [S1: 6428 A6: Formula: Σk² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Base: n=1 gives 1=1(2)(3)/6=1 ✓. Assume true for n=k. For n=k+1: add (k+1)² to both sides, algebraically simplify to (k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)/6, matching the formula for n=k+1.]  
Q7. Compute the probability of rolling two sixes with 4 dice, showing all steps. [S1: 2947 A7: Use binomial probability: C(4,2) × (1/6)² × (5/6)² = 6 × (1/36) × (25/36) = 150/1296 = 25/216 ≈ 0.116 or 11.6%.]  
Q8. Solve: a population doubles every 7 years. How long until it's 10× larger? Use logarithms in your explanation. [S1: 5612 A8: 2^(t/7) = 10. Taking logarithms: (t/7)×ln(2) = ln(10). Therefore t = 7×ln(10)/ln(2) = 7×log₂(10) = 7×3.322 ≈ 23.25 years.]  
Q9. Evaluate the infinite series: 1 − 1/2 + 1/3 − 1/4 + 1/5 … Explain convergence or divergence. [S1: 9183 A9: This is the alternating harmonic series. It converges to ln(2) ≈ 0.693 by the alternating series test (terms decrease monotonically to zero). Unlike the harmonic series, alternation ensures convergence despite 1/n → 0 slowly.]  
Q10. Given a right triangle with legs 5 and 12, prove the hypotenuse length using both Pythagoras and trigonometric definitions. [S1: 4765 A10: Pythagorean: c² = 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169, so c = 13. Trigonometric: tan(θ) = 5/12, θ = arctan(5/12). Then c = 5/sin(θ) = 12/cos(θ) = 13.]  

## Science & Engineering
Q11. Explain why ice floats on water while most solids sink in their liquids. Compare with at least one counterexample. [S1: 8321 A11: Water expands when freezing due to hydrogen bonds forming hexagonal crystal lattice, making ice ~9% less dense than liquid water. Most substances contract when solidifying. Counterexample: bismuth also expands when freezing, so solid bismuth floats on liquid bismuth.]  
Q12. Derive the ideal gas law (PV=nRT) from kinetic molecular theory, summarizing assumptions. [S1: 1549 A12: Assumptions: point particles, elastic collisions, no intermolecular forces, random motion. Pressure from collision momentum transfer: P = (1/3)×(N/V)×m×v²ᵣₘₛ. With kinetic energy = (3/2)kT and N = nNₐ, substituting yields PV = nRT where R = Nₐk.]  
Q13. Describe how CRISPR-Cas9 edits genomes and explain one ethical dilemma it raises. [S1: 7038 A13: Cas9 protein uses guide RNA to locate specific DNA sequences, creates double-strand breaks, then cell repair mechanisms insert/delete/replace genes. Ethical dilemma: germline editing creates heritable changes, potentially creating genetic inequality or unforeseen consequences for future generations.]  
Q14. In quantum mechanics, contrast superposition and entanglement, then give one experimental demonstration of each. [S1: 3892 A14: Superposition: single particle exists in multiple states simultaneously until measured. Entanglement: two particles share correlated quantum states regardless of distance. Demonstrations: Double-slit experiment shows superposition (interference pattern); Bell inequality violations demonstrate entanglement (EPR pairs).]  
Q15. Why does relativity predict time dilation near light speed? Derive with the Lorentz factor. [S1: 6254 A15: Speed of light is constant for all observers. Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) emerges from spacetime interval invariance. Time in moving frame: Δt' = γΔt. As v→c, γ→∞, so moving clocks run slower relative to stationary observers.]  

## Computer Science
Q16. Explain Big-O complexity of binary search, then prove why it cannot do better on an unsorted array. [S1: 2471 A16: Binary search is O(log n) on sorted arrays—halving search space each iteration. On unsorted arrays, no ordering information exists to eliminate half the elements without checking them. Must examine each element at least once in worst case: O(n) minimum.]  
Q17. Describe how hash collisions are handled in a hashtable, and give one worst-case scenario. [S1: 5829 A17: Common methods: chaining (linked lists at each bucket) or open addressing (probing for next empty slot). Worst case: all keys hash to same bucket, degrading to O(n) linked list search instead of O(1) average case.]  
Q18. Contrast supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning with one example each. [S1: 9147 A18: Supervised: learns from labeled input-output pairs (image classification). Unsupervised: finds patterns in unlabeled data (clustering customers). Reinforcement: learns through trial-and-error with rewards (game playing AI like chess).]  
Q19. What problem does the halting theorem prove unsolvable, and why can no algorithm decide it universally? [S1: 3618 A19: Whether an arbitrary program halts or runs forever on given input. Proof by contradiction: if halting decider H exists, construct program P that halts iff H says P loops, creating paradox. Thus H cannot exist.]  
Q20. Explain how consensus is reached in blockchain, comparing proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. [S1: 7953 A20: Proof-of-work: miners solve computational puzzles to validate blocks, energy-intensive but secure. Proof-of-stake: validators chosen based on coin holdings, energy-efficient but risks centralization. Both prevent double-spending through distributed agreement on transaction order.]  

## History & Philosophy
Q21. Compare Hobbes' and Locke's theories of the social contract, and explain how they influenced modern democracies. [S1: 1286 A21: Hobbes: humans surrender all rights to absolute sovereign to escape violent state of nature. Locke: limited government protects natural rights (life, liberty, property), revolution justified if violated. Locke's ideas shaped constitutional democracy, separation of powers, and individual rights.]  
Q22. Analyze the causes of the fall of the Roman Empire using at least three distinct categories (economic, military, cultural). [S1: 4702 A22: Economic: currency debasement, taxation burden, trade disruption. Military: barbarian invasions, overextension, reliance on foreign mercenaries. Cultural: Christianity replacing traditional values, loss of civic virtue, administrative division between East and West.]  
Q23. What is the Ship of Theseus paradox, and how would a materialist vs. a dualist philosopher resolve it differently? [S1: 8415 A23: If a ship's parts are gradually replaced, is it the same ship? Materialist: identity tied to physical continuity, so it's a different ship. Dualist: identity transcends matter through form/essence/consciousness, so it remains the same ship.]  
Q24. Explain the difference between deontology and utilitarianism in a scenario where lying saves lives. [S1: 2967 A24: Deontology (Kant): lying is categorically wrong regardless of consequences—moral duty is absolute. Utilitarianism (Mill): lying is justified if it maximizes overall happiness/well-being—saving lives outweighs the harm of deception.]  
Q25. Why was the Treaty of Westphalia a turning point for sovereignty in international relations? [S1: 6134 A25: Ended Thirty Years' War (1648), established principle of territorial sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs. Created modern state system where rulers have supreme authority within borders, replacing medieval overlapping religious and feudal authorities.]  

## Applied Problem Solving
Q26. A farmer must cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. He can only take one at a time. Devise the step sequence to succeed. [S1: 3758 A26: 1) Take goat across. 2) Return alone. 3) Take wolf across. 4) Return with goat. 5) Take cabbage across. 6) Return alone. 7) Take goat across. Wolf never alone with goat, goat never alone with cabbage.]  
Q27. A store advertises "Buy one, get one half off." If items cost $30 each, compare effective discount with a flat 25% off. [S1: 9521 A27: BOGO half off: 2 items for $30 + $15 = $45, or $22.50 each, saving 25%. Flat 25% off: $22.50 each. Identical discount rates, but BOGO requires buying pairs.]  
Q28. A building elevator is rated for 10 people or 800 kg. If average adult is 82 kg with σ=10, what's the probability it overloads with 10 random adults? [S1: 5087 A28: Sum of 10 adults: mean = 820 kg, σ = √(10×100) = 31.6 kg. P(total > 800) = P(Z > (800-820)/31.6) = P(Z > -0.63) ≈ 0.736 or 73.6%.]  
Q29. Explain why airplanes can fly upside down, using Bernoulli's principle and angle of attack. [S1: 7642 A29: Lift primarily comes from angle of attack deflecting air downward (Newton's third law), not just wing shape. Inverted flight maintains positive angle of attack relative to airflow by pitching nose up, generating lift despite inverted airfoil.]  
Q30. A company has 4 engineers, 3 designers, 2 marketers. How many unique 3-person teams can be formed with at least 1 engineer? [S1: 2315 A30: Total 3-person teams: C(9,3) = 84. Teams with no engineers: C(5,3) = 10. Teams with at least 1 engineer: 84 - 10 = 74.]  

## Creativity Under Constraints
Q31. Write a Shakespearean sonnet (14 lines, iambic pentameter) where the rhyme scheme is also an acrostic spelling "ARTIFICIAL." [S1: 8976 A31: Too complex for concise answer—requires 14 lines of iambic pentameter with specific rhyme scheme ABABCDCDEFEFGG where first letters spell ARTIFICIAL.]  
Q32. Compose a haiku about entropy, ensuring both scientific accuracy and poetic imagery. [S1: 4293 A32: "Order dissolves slow / Ice melts to formless water / Time's arrow flies true"]  
Q33. Invent a new word for "fear of forgetting" and define its etymology. [S1: 6857 A33: "Lethophobia" - from Greek "lethe" (forgetfulness/oblivion, mythical river of forgetting) + "phobia" (fear). The irrational fear of losing memories or forgetting important information.]  
Q34. Write a story of exactly 50 words that contains a paradox. [S1: 1428 A34: The time traveler arrived yesterday to prevent his own birth. He succeeded. Yet here he stood, existing despite never being born. His grandfather smiled knowingly. "You're not the first to try," he said. "Paradoxes have a way of resolving themselves." The traveler vanished, but his footprints remained forever.]  
Q35. Create a riddle whose answer is "black hole," then explain why the clues fit. [S1: 3961 A35: "I feast on light yet remain dark, grow heavier as I eat, bend space and time around me, from my grasp nothing can retreat." Black holes trap light (dark), gain mass from consumption, curve spacetime, and nothing escapes past event horizon.]  

## Multi-Domain Synthesis
Q36. Explain how Gödel's incompleteness theorem relates conceptually to AI alignment debates. [S1: 7524 A36: Gödel proved formal systems cannot be both complete and consistent. Similarly, AI alignment faces fundamental limits: we cannot formally specify all human values completely and consistently. Any rule system will have edge cases, requiring judgment beyond formal specification.]  
Q37. Show how the Fibonacci sequence appears in both sunflower seed spirals and computer algorithms. [S1: 2689 A37: Sunflowers: seed spirals follow Fibonacci numbers (34, 55, 89) optimizing packing density via golden angle. Algorithms: Fibonacci heap data structure, dynamic programming examples, and computational biology for modeling population growth and tree branching patterns.]  
Q38. Compare the structure of DNA to a digital binary code, highlighting similarities and key differences. [S1: 5142 A38: Similarities: discrete units encode information, error correction mechanisms, sequential reading. Differences: DNA uses quaternary code (ATCG) not binary, 3D structure affects function, redundant codons, epigenetic modifications add layers beyond sequence.]  
Q39. Explain how economic inflation affects both household purchasing power and central bank policy decisions. [S1: 8735 A39: Households: inflation erodes savings value and real wages, requiring more money for same goods. Central banks: raise interest rates to cool economy and reduce inflation, balance employment vs price stability mandate, adjust money supply through various tools.]  
Q40. Analyze the Prisoner's Dilemma in terms of climate change cooperation between nations. [S1: 3278 A40: Each nation benefits from others reducing emissions while continuing to pollute (defect). If all cooperate, everyone benefits. If all defect, catastrophic warming. Nash equilibrium is mutual defection despite cooperation being globally optimal—requires enforcement mechanisms.]  

## Edge-Case Reasoning
Q41. Can infinity be even or odd? Explain mathematically and philosophically. [S1: 6913 A41: Mathematically: even/odd applies only to integers, infinity isn't a number but a concept/limit. Philosophically: category error—like asking color of justice. Cardinal infinities (aleph numbers) form different mathematical structure than integers.]  
Q42. If AI agents can generate laws, should humans still legislate? Debate both sides. [S1: 2456 A42: Yes: democratic legitimacy requires human consent, accountability, and value judgments beyond optimization. No: AI could eliminate bias, process more variables, adapt faster to changing conditions. Hybrid approach likely optimal.]  
Q43. Why can't perpetual motion machines exist under current physics? [S1: 7891 A43: First law of thermodynamics: energy cannot be created, only transformed. Second law: entropy always increases, some energy becomes unusable heat. Any machine has friction/resistance, requiring energy input to maintain motion.]  
Q44. Explain Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, then discuss its misinterpretations in popular culture. [S1: 4523 A44: Cat in box with quantum-triggered poison is supposedly alive/dead simultaneously until observed, illustrating measurement problem. Misinterpretation: consciousness creates reality. Actually critiques Copenhagen interpretation—macroscopic superposition is absurd.]  
Q45. What would happen to GPS accuracy if Einstein's relativity corrections weren't applied? [S1: 9087 A45: GPS satellites experience time dilation (special relativity: -7 μs/day) and gravitational time dilation (general relativity: +45 μs/day), net +38 μs/day faster. Without corrections, positioning errors accumulate ~10 km/day.]  

## Constraint & Meta-Reasoning
Q46. Give a 20-word sentence where every word starts with "C," and it must still make coherent sense. [S1: 3654 A46: "Clever cats carefully catch curious critters, creating considerable chaos; consequently, concerned citizens call competent cat catchers, containing cats' creative conquests."]  
Q47. Define "justice" in exactly 7 words, no synonyms for fairness allowed. [S1: 8219 A47: "Giving each person their rightful due treatment."]  
Q48. Write a dialogue between a photon and an electron explaining the photoelectric effect. [S1: 5762 A48: Photon: "I carry energy E=hf." Electron: "If your energy exceeds my binding energy, I'll escape!" Photon: "One photon, one electron—intensity irrelevant." Electron: "Above threshold, your excess energy becomes my kinetic energy."]  
Q49. Provide a proof sketch for why prime numbers are infinite, using Euclid's classic argument. [S1: 1395 A49: Assume finite primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Consider N = (p₁×p₂×...×pₙ) + 1. N is not divisible by any pᵢ (remainder 1). So N is either prime itself or has a prime factor not in our list. Contradiction.]  
Q50. Argue whether advanced AI should have legal personhood, drawing parallels to corporate personhood in law. [S1: 6448 A50: Corporations have legal personhood for practical purposes (contracts, liability) without consciousness. Similarly, AI personhood could enable accountability and rights protection without requiring sentience. However, unlike corporations with human stakeholders, AI lacks inherent interests requiring protection.]
