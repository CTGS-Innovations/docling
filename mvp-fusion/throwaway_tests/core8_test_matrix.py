Core-8 Test Matrix - Comprehensive Coverage Validation
======================================================

GOAL: Create visible test matrix for user validation of comprehensive coverage
REASON: User needs to verify test cases cover all areas properly
PROBLEM: Need transparent view of what's being tested across Core-8 entities

TEST MATRIX STRUCTURE:
- DATE: Various formats, ranges, negatives, edge cases
- TIME: 12/24 hour, ranges, AM/PM, edge cases  
- MONEY: Currencies, ranges, negatives, multipliers
- MEASUREMENT: Units, ranges, negatives, scientific notation

ORDER OF OPERATIONS: WIDEST TO NARROWEST (CORRECTED)
1. Complete entity ranges with full context
2. Complete single entities 
3. Partial entities with units
4. Bare numbers (lowest priority)
