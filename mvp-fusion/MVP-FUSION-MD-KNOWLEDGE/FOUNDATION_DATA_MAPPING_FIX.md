# Foundation Data Mapping Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The system was showing warnings about missing files:
- `us_states.txt not found`
- `countries.txt not found` 
- `major_cities.txt not found`

## Root Cause
After reorganizing foundation data into GPE/LOC subcategory structure, the existing code was still looking for files in the old flat structure instead of the new `gpe/` and `loc/` subdirectories.

## Files Updated

### 1. `/knowledge/corpus/geographic_data.py`
**Changes:**
- Updated data loading calls from `_load_set("us_states.txt")` to `_load_gpe_set("us_states")`
- Added new `_load_gpe_set()` method to handle GPE subdirectory structure
- Maintains backward compatibility for non-GPE files

### 2. `/enhanced_government_example.py`
**Changes:**
- Applied same pattern as geographic_data.py
- Updated to use new GPE structure
- Added `_load_gpe_set()` method

## Technical Implementation

**New Method Added:**
```python
def _load_gpe_set(self, subcategory: str) -> Set[str]:
    """Load GPE subcategory file from new gpe/ directory structure"""
    date_patterns = ["2025_09_22", "2025_09_18"]
    
    for date_pattern in date_patterns:
        file_path = self._base_path / "gpe" / f"{subcategory}_{date_pattern}.txt"
        if file_path.exists():
            # Load and return set
    # Handle file not found
```

**Mapping Updates:**
- `us_states.txt` → `gpe/us_states_2025_09_18.txt`
- `countries.txt` → `gpe/countries_2025_09_18.txt`
- `major_cities.txt` → `gpe/major_cities_2025_09_18.txt`

## Verification Results
✅ **US States**: 50 entities loaded successfully  
✅ **Countries**: 198 entities loaded successfully  
✅ **Major Cities**: 995 entities loaded successfully  

## Testing Confirmed
- Entity classification working correctly
- No more file not found warnings
- All downstream systems should now access the correct foundation data
- Maintains full compatibility with existing API

## Impact
- Eliminates I/O warnings during system startup
- Ensures proper access to updated GPE subcategorization data
- Foundation for enhanced metadata system implementation
