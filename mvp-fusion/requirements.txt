# MVP-Fusion Requirements
# =======================
# High-performance document processing pipeline

# Core dependencies
pyyaml>=6.0
psutil>=5.9.0

# High-performance regex engines (optional but recommended)
# Install these for maximum performance:
# flpc>=0.2.0              # Rust-backed regex (14.9x faster than Python re)
# pyahocorasick>=2.0.0     # Aho-Corasick automaton (50M+ chars/sec)

# Optional performance dependencies
numpy>=1.21.0             # For vectorized operations
asyncio                   # For async processing (built-in Python 3.7+)

# Development and testing
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0

# Note: MVP-Fusion is designed to work without the optional dependencies
# but will use Python's built-in libraries with reduced performance.
# For maximum speed, install flpc and pyahocorasick:
#
#   pip install flpc pyahocorasick
#
# Performance comparison:
# - Python re:        4.6M chars/sec  (baseline)
# - FLPC (Rust):     69M chars/sec    (14.9x faster)  
# - Aho-Corasick:    50M chars/sec    (keyword matching)
