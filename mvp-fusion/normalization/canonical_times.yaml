# Canonical Map for TIME entities
# Rules for normalization and identification
# Normalize to ISO 8601 time (HH:MM[:SS]) with 24-hour clock

time:
  canonical_unit: "ISO_8601_time"
  conversions: {}
  regex_hint: "\\b[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}(?::[0-9]{2})?\\s*(AM|PM|am|pm)?\\b|\\b[0-2]?[0-9][0-5][0-9]\\b"
  notes:
    - Convert 12-hour times with AM/PM to 24-hour format
    - Normalize missing seconds as HH:MM
    - Handle compact HHMM forms by inferring colon (e.g., 0930 â†’ 09:30)
