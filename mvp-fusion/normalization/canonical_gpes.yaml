# Canonical Map for Geo-Political Entities (GPE)
# Rules for normalization and identification
# Uses Acorisc dictionaries for country/state/city lookup

# FLPC Performance Guidelines:
# - Avoid lookaheads/lookbehinds
# - Use explicit alternations and simple character classes

  conversions:
    # Country synonyms to ISO A2 codes (sample subset; extend via dictionary at runtime)

  notes:
    - Prefer dictionary to disambiguate common words from GPE names
    - Canonical form uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes for countries; subnational codes may use ISO 3166-2
    - Preserve full surface text for display; store canonical code in structured YAML
