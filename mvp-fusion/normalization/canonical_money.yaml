# Canonical Map for MONEY entities
# Rules for normalization and identification
# Normalize to (amount, ISO_4217 currency) without applying FX rates

money:
  canonical_unit: "amount_currency"
  conversions:
    # Symbol to ISO 4217 mappings (non-exhaustive; extend via runtime tables)
    "$": "USD"
    "€": "EUR"
    "£": "GBP"
    "¥": "JPY"
    "₹": "INR"
    "₩": "KRW"
    "₽": "RUB"
  regex_hint: "(\$|€|£|¥|₹|₩|₽)?[0-9,]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?(?:\\s*(USD|EUR|GBP|JPY|CNY|CAD|AUD|INR|KRW|RUB))?"
  notes:
    - Preserve original currency if both symbol and code present (symbol wins for locale-specific sums)
    - Do not apply exchange rates; store canonical as {amount: float, currency: ISO}
    - Strip thousands separators, keep decimal precision; validate non-negative amounts
