# Canonical Map for ORGANIZATION entities
# Rules for normalization and identification
# Uses Acorisc dictionaries for fast org lookup
#
# FLPC Performance Guidelines:
# - Avoid lookaheads/lookbehinds
# - Use explicit alternations and simple character classes
# - Prefer literal suffix alternations (Inc|LLC|Ltd) over wildcards

organization:
  canonical_unit: "legal_name"
  conversions:
    # Normalize common legal suffix variants to a standard short form
    "Incorporated": "Inc"
    "Inc.": "Inc"
    "Corporation": "Corp"
    "Corp.": "Corp"
    "Company": "Co"
    "Co.": "Co"
    "Limited": "Ltd"
    "Ltd.": "Ltd"
    "LLC": "LLC"
    "PLC": "PLC"
    "GmbH": "GmbH"
    "S.A.": "SA"
    "S.A": "SA"
  dictionary_hint: "organization_names.dict"
  regex_hint: "[A-Z][A-Za-z]*(?:\\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z]*)*\\s+(Inc|Incorporated|Corp|Corporation|LLC|Ltd|Limited|Company|Co|PLC|GmbH|SA)\\.?"
  notes:
    - Preserve original casing; normalize legal suffix to a standard short form in canonical output
    - Remove trailing punctuation from suffix (e.g., Inc., Ltd.)
    - Merge consecutive capitalized tokens as the organization name prior to suffix
    - Prefer dictionary matches to boost precision for short names and acronyms
