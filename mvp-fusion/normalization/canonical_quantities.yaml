# Canonical Map for QUANTITY entities
# Rules for normalization and identification
# Generic quantities (counts, percentages without symbol, ratios) to canonical numeric form

quantity:
  canonical_unit: "number"
  conversions: {}
  regex_hint: "\\b[0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?\\b"
  notes:
    - Plain numeric quantities without explicit units (handled in measurement maps otherwise)
    - Preserve significant digits; store as float or int depending on presence of decimal
    - Exclude monetary and percentage forms when symbol/keywords detected (handled elsewhere)
