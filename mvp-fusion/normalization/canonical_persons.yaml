# Canonical Map for PERSON entities
# Rules for normalization and identification
# Uses Acorisc dictionaries for fast name lookup
#
# FLPC Performance Guidelines:
# - Avoid lookaheads/lookbehinds
# - Use explicit alternations and simple character classes
# - Prefer [A-Z][a-z]+ over lazy wildcards

person:
  canonical_unit: "full_name"
  conversions: {}
  dictionary_hint: "person_names.dict"
  regex_hint: "(Mr|Mrs|Ms|Mx|Dr|Prof)\\.?\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\\s+[A-Z][a-z]+){0,2}"
  notes:
    - Preserve original casing for display; normalize internally to "First Last"
    - Titles (Mr, Ms, Dr, Prof) are optional and removed in canonical form
    - Middle names or initials retained when present; whitespace normalized
    - Suffixes (Jr, Sr, II, III, IV) kept as suffix tokens when detected
    - Use dictionary match to boost confidence and filter false positives
