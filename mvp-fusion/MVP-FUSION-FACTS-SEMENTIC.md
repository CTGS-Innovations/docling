# Founder's Journey Semantic Knowledge Extraction Framework

A comprehensive system for extracting structured, actionable intelligence from hundreds of thousands of websites to power the complete **Founder's Journey** - giving entrepreneurs everything they need to make informed market entry decisions.

## Core Philosophy: Full-Stack Founder Intelligence

Scout extracts semantic facts across **12 critical decision areas** that determine startup success or failure. While others use generic AI summarization, we extract structured, comparable facts that provide founders with intelligence advantages over incumbents.

## The Founder's Journey: From Idea to Exit Strategy

Every market entry decision requires intelligence across these interconnected areas:
- **Market & Capital Flows** â†’ Is there opportunity and funding?
- **Competition & Users** â†’ Who are we displacing and why will they switch?
- **Talent & Regulation** â†’ Can we build and operate legally?
- **Growth & Exit** â†’ How do we scale and where does this lead?

## ðŸŸ¢ 6. Pattern Matching Implementation (Aho-Corasick + Rust Regex)

### **What's Achievable with Your Current Tech Stack**

**âœ… High-Confidence Patterns (Aho-Corasick Multi-Pattern Matching)**:
```rust
// Market size extraction patterns
"$X billion market" | "$X.Y billion industry" | "market valued at $X"
"growing at X% CAGR" | "X% annual growth" | "projected to reach $X"

// Funding announcement patterns  
"raised $X Series [A-D]" | "closes $X funding round" | "$X investment led by"
"Series [A-D] of $X" | "secured $X from [Investor]"

// Competitive positioning patterns
"market leader in" | "leading provider of" | "#1 in [category]"
"holds X% market share" | "ranks #X in [market]"
```

**âœ… Structured Fact Extraction (Rust Regex)**:
```rust
// Investment rounds
r"(?P<company>\w+)\s+raised\s+\$(?P<amount>[\d.]+\s*[BMK]?)\s+Series\s+(?P<round>[A-D])"

// Market metrics  
r"market\s+(?:valued|worth|size)\s+(?:of\s+)?\$(?P<amount>[\d.]+\s*[BMK]?)"

// Pain points
r"(?P<users>[\w\s]+)\s+(?:struggle|complain|frustrated)\s+(?:with|about)\s+(?P<pain>[\w\s]+)"

// Tech stack mentions
r"built\s+(?:with|using|on)\s+(?P<tech>[\w\s,+]+)"
```

### **Performance Advantage**
- **Single Pass**: All patterns processed simultaneously across hundreds of thousands of websites
- **Linear Scaling**: Adding 1000 patterns costs same as adding 10 patterns  
- **No AI Overhead**: Direct pattern matching without model inference costs
