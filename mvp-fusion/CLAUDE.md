# MVP-FUSION DEVELOPMENT RULES

## CORE PRINCIPLE: SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### **Rule #1: No Redundant Files**
- One solution per problem
- No iterations, experiments, or "backup" implementations
- Delete replaced files immediately
- Clean, definitive implementations only

### **Rule #2: Clean Architecture**
- Pay setup costs once, not incrementally
- Initialization phase separate from processing
- Direct, minimal processing paths
- No nested abstractions or complex pipelines

### **Rule #3: Code Quality Standards**
- Well-commented, self-documenting code
- Clear variable names and function purposes  
- Production-ready, not experimental
- Single responsibility per class/function

### **Rule #4: Performance First**
- Every design decision optimized for speed
- Measure performance, don't assume
- Use proven patterns (like MVP-Hyper's approach)
- Eliminate overhead at every level

### **Rule #5: File Organization**
```
mvp-fusion/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ultra_fast_fusion.py     # THE solution (replaces pipeline/, fusion/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fusion_cli.py           # Clean CLI interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                 # Configuration only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md              # These rules
```

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### **Before Creating New Files:**
1. Can this be added to existing file?
2. Does this replace existing functionality?
3. Is this the definitive solution?
4. Will this create confusion or redundancy?

### **When Modifying Code:**
1. Update existing file, don't create new version
2. Remove replaced functionality immediately  
3. Maintain single source of truth
4. Comment why changes improve performance

### **Quality Gates:**
- No duplicate functionality across files
- No experimental or "temp" files in production
- Clear performance improvements documented
- Single, obvious entry point for each capability

### **Rule #7: Temporary File Naming Convention**
For testing, trials, and temporary code that will be removed:
- **Always append `_TMP` to filename**: `test_extraction_TMP.py`
- **Use for**: validation scripts, experimental code, testing utilities
- **Purpose**: Clear identification of files to be removed after testing
- **Cleanup**: Remove all `_TMP` files before production deployment

**Examples:**
```
‚úÖ Good: validation_script_TMP.py, test_performance_TMP.py
‚ùå Bad: test.py, temp_file.py, experimental_code.py
```

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

### **Rule #6: Clear Decision Points**
When presenting options or asking questions:

üî¥ **DECISION NEEDED** üî¥
- Use red blocks for critical decisions
- Put the question/action at the top, not buried in text
- Provide clear options (A, B, C)
- Make the call-to-action obvious

**Example:**
```
üî¥ **DECISION NEEDED** üî¥
Should I implement X or Y approach?
Option A: Quick fix (5 min)
Option B: Full refactor (30 min)
```

**These rules prevent codebase clutter and maintain focus on performance and clarity.**
