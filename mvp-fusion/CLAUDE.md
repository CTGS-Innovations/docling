# MVP-FUSION DEVELOPMENT RULES

## CORE PRINCIPLE: SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### **Rule #1: No Redundant Files**
- One solution per problem
- No iterations, experiments, or "backup" implementations
- Delete replaced files immediately
- Clean, definitive implementations only

### **Rule #2: Clean Architecture**
- Pay setup costs once, not incrementally
- Initialization phase separate from processing
- Direct, minimal processing paths
- No nested abstractions or complex pipelines

### **Rule #3: Code Quality Standards**
- Well-commented, self-documenting code
- Clear variable names and function purposes  
- Production-ready, not experimental
- Single responsibility per class/function

### **Rule #4: Performance First**
- Every design decision optimized for speed
- Measure performance, don't assume
- Use proven patterns (like MVP-Hyper's approach)
- Eliminate overhead at every level

### **Rule #5: URL and File Processing Equivalence - MANDATORY**
**CRITICAL**: There is no difference between processing a URL or a file - they use the same pipeline:

**üöÄ UNIFIED PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE:**
1. **URL Processing**: Download ‚Üí Convert HTML to Markdown ‚Üí Process through standard pipeline
2. **File Processing**: Read file ‚Üí Process through standard pipeline
3. **Same Pipeline**: Both URLs and files go through identical stages (convert ‚Üí classify ‚Üí enrich ‚Üí normalize ‚Üí extract)
4. **Same Output Format**: Both generate identical YAML frontmatter and semantic JSON
5. **Single or Batch**: One URL or list of URLs - all use same pipeline instance

**‚úÖ REQUIREMENTS:**
- URLs must show `source_type: url` and `source_url` in YAML frontmatter
- Files must show `source_type: file` and `source_path` in YAML frontmatter  
- Both use CleanFusionPipeline (not legacy FusionPipeline)
- Batch processing initializes pipeline ONCE for all items
- Entity extraction works identically (shows ||entity||id|| markers)
- HTML-to-markdown conversion happens before pipeline processing

**‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT:**
Any difference in URL vs file processing violates the unified architecture principle and creates unnecessary complexity.

### **Rule #12: FLPC Pattern Matching - MANDATORY**
**CRITICAL**: NEVER use regular expressions (re module) - use FLPC (Fast Lexical Pattern Compiler) instead:

**üö® ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - ZERO TOLERANCE:**
```python
import re
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d+)\s*(feet|ft)')
match = pattern.search(text)
for match in re.finditer(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):  # NEVER!
```

**‚úÖ REQUIRED - ALWAYS USE FLPC:**
```python
from fusion.flpc_engine import FLPCEngine
flpc_engine = FLPCEngine(config)
results = flpc_engine.extract_entities(text)
```

**üöÄ Why FLPC is MANDATORY:**
- **14.9x faster** than Python regex (69M+ chars/sec proven performance)
- **Rust-backed** compiled patterns for maximum performance  
- **Non-linear cost** - complex and simple patterns have same performance
- **Single-pass processing** instead of multiple regex iterations
- **Critical for high-throughput** entity processing at 10,000+ pages/sec
- **Part of performance-first architecture** - violating this destroys pipeline speed

**üìä PERFORMANCE IMPACT:**
- Python regex: ~155ms per document (366 pages/sec)
- FLPC: ~1ms per document (10,000+ pages/sec) 
- **Performance degradation: 40x slower** when using Python regex

**üîß APPLIES TO:**
- All entity extraction (dates, money, measurements, etc.)
- All pattern matching in text processing
- All content analysis and validation
- All normalization and cleanup operations

**‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT:**
This rule violation causes **massive performance degradation** and is **non-negotiable**. Any Python regex usage must be immediately replaced with FLPC.

### **Rule #5: File Organization**
```
mvp-fusion/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ultra_fast_fusion.py     # THE solution (replaces pipeline/, fusion/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fusion_cli.py           # Clean CLI interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                 # Configuration only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md              # These rules
```

### **Rule #9: Python Virtual Environment - MANDATORY**
**CRITICAL**: When working in `/home/corey/projects/docling/mvp-fusion/`:
- **ALWAYS** use the .venv-clean virtual environment for ALL Python commands
- **NEVER** run `python` directly - always use `source .venv-clean/bin/activate && python`
- This applies to: testing, running scripts, installing packages, debugging

**Examples:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
cd /home/corey/projects/docling/mvp-fusion
source .venv-clean/bin/activate && python fusion_cli.py --help

# ‚ùå WRONG  
cd /home/corey/projects/docling/mvp-fusion
python fusion_cli.py --help
```

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### **Before Creating New Files:**
1. Can this be added to existing file?
2. Does this replace existing functionality?
3. Is this the definitive solution?
4. Will this create confusion or redundancy?

### **When Modifying Code:**
1. Update existing file, don't create new version
2. Remove replaced functionality immediately  
3. Maintain single source of truth
4. Comment why changes improve performance

### **Quality Gates:**
- No duplicate functionality across files
- No experimental or "temp" files in production
- Clear performance improvements documented
- Single, obvious entry point for each capability

### **Rule #7: Temporary File Naming Convention**
For testing, trials, and temporary code that will be removed:
- **Always append `_TMP` to filename**: `test_extraction_TMP.py`
- **Use for**: validation scripts, experimental code, testing utilities
- **Purpose**: Clear identification of files to be removed after testing
- **Cleanup**: Remove all `_TMP` files before production deployment

**Examples:**
```
‚úÖ Good: validation_script_TMP.py, test_performance_TMP.py
‚ùå Bad: test.py, temp_file.py, experimental_code.py
```

---

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

### **Rule #6: Clear Decision Points**
When presenting options or asking questions:

üî¥ **DECISION NEEDED** üî¥
- Use red blocks for critical decisions
- Put the question/action at the top, not buried in text
- Provide clear options (A, B, C)
- Make the call-to-action obvious

**Example:**
```
üî¥ **DECISION NEEDED** üî¥
Should I implement X or Y approach?
Option A: Quick fix (5 min)
Option B: Full refactor (30 min)
```

### **Rule #8: CRITICAL - Stop and Discuss Before Pivoting**
When errors or failures occur:

üõë **MANDATORY DISCUSSION BEFORE ACTION** üõë
- **NEVER** immediately implement fixes or workarounds
- **STOP** and analyze the root problem first
- **DISCUSS** the issue and potential approaches with user
- **AVOID** hard pivots without consultation
- **ASK** before changing architecture or adding fallbacks

**Process:**
1. **Identify**: What exactly failed and why?
2. **Analyze**: What are the real options to fix it?
3. **Discuss**: Present options and get user direction
4. **Then** implement the chosen approach

**Critical Flaw to Avoid:**
‚ùå Error occurs ‚Üí immediately implement fallback/fix
‚úÖ Error occurs ‚Üí stop ‚Üí discuss ‚Üí get direction ‚Üí implement

### **Rule #10: Inline Test Documentation - MANDATORY**
When using Python `-c` commands for testing or debugging:

**ALWAYS** include a brief comment block at the top explaining:
- **GOAL**: What I'm trying to test
- **REASON**: Why I need to test this  
- **PROBLEM**: What I think might be wrong

**Example Format:**
```python
python -c "
# GOAL: Test if semantic fact extractor works after method fix
# REASON: Pipeline runs all stages but generates no JSON files
# PROBLEM: Missing _extract_entity_context method causing extractor to fail

# ... actual test code here ...
"
```

**Purpose**: User can read the comment to understand the test context when execution isn't visible.

### **Rule #11: Structured Entity Logging Standard**
For entity processing across all layers (Global, Domain, Future layers):

**MANDATORY FORMAT**: Maximum 2 lines per processing layer
```
üìä Global entities: person:139, org:4, loc:2, money:10, date:5
üéØ Domain entities: organizations:7, locations:33, financial:12
```

**Requirements:**
- **One line per layer** (Global, Domain, etc.)
- **Only show non-zero counts** (skip empty categories)
- **Use consistent emojis**: üìä Global, üéØ Domain, üß† Semantic, etc.
- **Condensed format**: `category:count, category:count`
- **NO individual entity logging** (no "- global_person: 139 entities" spam)

**Purpose**: 
- Shows knowledge baseline before enrichment/classification
- Enables quick scanning of entity distribution
- Reduces log noise from verbose entity-by-entity output
- Scalable for future processing layers

**Example Expansion for Future Layers:**
```
üìä Global entities: person:139, org:4, money:10
üéØ Domain entities: organizations:7, locations:33  
üß† Semantic entities: facts:45, rules:12, relationships:8
üîó Linked entities: canonical:156, resolved:23
```

### **Rule #13: Status Indicators - MANDATORY**
Use color-coded indicators for all status updates and task reporting:

**REQUIRED INDICATORS:**
```
üü¢ **SUCCESS** - Task completed successfully
üü° **WAITING** - Task in progress or waiting for input  
üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Task blocked or failed, needs attention
```

**Usage Examples:**
```
üü¢ **SUCCESS**: Entity normalization completed (126 entities processed)
üü° **WAITING**: Processing document batch 3 of 5...
üî¥ **BLOCKED**: FLPC pattern compilation failed - missing dependency
```

**Requirements:**
- Use at start of status messages for immediate visual scanning
- Include brief context after the indicator
- Apply consistently across all logging and user communication
- Essential for debugging and progress tracking

**Why This Matters:**
- Instant visual status recognition
- Quick problem identification in logs
- Consistent user experience across all tools
- Critical for high-throughput processing monitoring

### **Rule #14: Blocked Status Resolution - MANDATORY**
When encountering üî¥ **BLOCKED** status, search Context7 for solutions after 3 attempts:

**PROCESS:**
1. **Identify the blocking issue** (dependency, API, pattern, etc.)
2. **Attempt to resolve** using existing knowledge (up to 3 attempts)
3. **After 3 failed attempts**: Search Context7 for relevant documentation/solutions
4. **Apply solution** if found in documentation
5. **Report outcome** with updated status indicator

**Example Workflow:**
```
üî¥ **BLOCKED**: FLPC pattern compilation failed - missing dependency
üü° **WAITING**: Attempt 1 - trying manual installation...
üî¥ **BLOCKED**: Still failing - missing library path
üü° **WAITING**: Attempt 2 - checking environment variables...
üî¥ **BLOCKED**: Still failing - wrong package version
üü° **WAITING**: Attempt 3 - trying different installation method...
üî¥ **BLOCKED**: 3 attempts failed - searching Context7 for FLPC installation docs...
üü¢ **SUCCESS**: Found solution in Context7 - installing flpc package
```

**When to Use Context7:**
- Missing dependencies or packages
- API usage errors or configuration issues  
- Pattern matching or regex problems
- Library-specific implementation questions
- Performance optimization techniques

**Requirements:**
- Try to resolve using existing knowledge first (3 attempts)
- Search Context7 only after 3 failed attempts
- Include Context7 search results in status updates
- Document the solution found for future reference
- Only escalate to user if Context7 has no solution

**Why This Matters:**
- Reduces interruptions and speeds up development
- Leverages up-to-date documentation automatically
- Creates self-healing development workflow
- Essential for autonomous problem resolution

### **Rule #15: Throwaway Tests Directory - MANDATORY**
**CRITICAL**: NEVER create temporary test files in the root directory - use throwaway_tests/ folder instead:

**üö® ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - ZERO TOLERANCE:**
```bash
# Creating temp files in root directory
touch test_performance_TMP.py
touch validation_script_TMP.py
touch experimental_code_TMP.py
```

**‚úÖ REQUIRED - ALWAYS USE throwaway_tests/ FOLDER:**
```bash
# All temporary files go in throwaway_tests/
mkdir -p throwaway_tests
touch throwaway_tests/test_performance.py
touch throwaway_tests/validation_script.py
touch throwaway_tests/experimental_code.py
```

**üöÄ Why throwaway_tests/ is MANDATORY:**
- **Prevents root directory clutter** - keeps workspace clean and organized
- **Clear deletion policy** - anything in throwaway_tests/ can always be deleted safely
- **No questioning required** - eliminates uncertainty about file importance
- **Easier cleanup** - single directory to clean when needed
- **Better organization** - separates temporary from production code

**üìÅ APPLIES TO:**
- All temporary test files and scripts
- Performance benchmarking code
- Validation and debugging utilities
- Experimental implementations
- Any file with `_TMP` suffix or temporary nature

**‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT:**
This rule prevents workspace pollution and is **non-negotiable**. Any temporary files in root directory violate clean architecture principles.

**üîß DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:**
```
mvp-fusion/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ throwaway_tests/          # ALL temporary files go here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_performance.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation_script.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ experimental_code.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline/                 # Production code only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                    # Production code only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fusion_cli.py            # Production code only
```

### **Rule #16: Architecture Patterns Reference - MANDATORY**
**CRITICAL**: Always reference `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md` for project-specific architectural patterns and definitions.

**üö® BEFORE implementing any architecture:**
- **READ** `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md` first
- **FOLLOW** the patterns defined in that document
- **NEVER** assume industry standard definitions override project patterns
- **ASK** if unsure about any architectural pattern

**üìÅ CONTAINS:**
- Pipeline Sidecar Pattern definition
- Service interface requirements
- A/B testing methodology
- Performance optimization approach

**‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT:**
Violating project architectural patterns wastes time and creates confusion. This rule ensures consistent implementation across all development work.

### **Rule #17: Decision Framework - MANDATORY**
**CRITICAL**: Before proposing ANY solution, use the Problem-Strategy-Rating Decision Framework.

**üö® MANDATORY REFERENCE:**
- **READ** `CLAUDE_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md` before proposing solutions
- **FOLLOW** the 3-step process: Problem ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Rating
- **NEVER** propose solutions that contradict user strategy
- **ALWAYS** rate options against user's explicit requirements

**üéØ PURPOSE:**
- Prevents misaligned solutions
- Ensures working systems remain intact
- Forces objective evaluation against user strategy
- Eliminates personal bias in solution selection

**‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT:**
This framework must be used before proposing any solution. Failure to follow this process leads to broken functionality and wasted development time.
