# GPU vs CPU Performance Comparison Feature

## Overview
The Docling Processing Center now includes automatic detection and tracking of compute resources (CPU vs GPU) used for document processing, enabling direct performance comparisons between different compute environments.

## Features Added

### 1. **Automatic Compute Detection**
- **Backend Detection**: Automatically detects available compute resources using PyTorch
- **Environment Logging**: Reports compute type (CPU/GPU) and details in processing logs
- **Metadata Tracking**: Stores compute information in job results for historical analysis

### 2. **Visual Compute Indicators**
- **Jobs Table Column**: New "Compute" column shows CPU üñ•Ô∏è or GPU üöÄ for each job
- **Color Coding**: 
  - GPU jobs: Green badge with rocket icon
  - CPU jobs: Blue badge with CPU chip icon
- **Tooltip Details**: Hover over compute badges to see detailed hardware information

### 3. **Performance Comparison Dashboard**
- **Executive Header**: Shows current compute mode (CPU/GPU)
- **Historical Tracking**: All jobs retain compute type information
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Easy visual comparison of processing times between GPU and CPU jobs

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **`torch_config.py`** - Added `get_compute_info()` function:
   ```python
   def get_compute_info():
       """Get information about the compute environment (CPU vs GPU)."""
       cuda_available = torch.cuda.is_available()
       
       if cuda_available:
           device_count = torch.cuda.device_count()
           device_name = torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)
           compute_type = "GPU"
           compute_details = f"{device_name} ({device_count} device(s))"
       else:
           cpu_count = os.cpu_count() or 4
           compute_type = "CPU"
           compute_details = f"{cpu_count} cores, {torch.get_num_threads()} threads"
   ```

2. **Enhanced ProcessingMetrics** - Added compute tracking:
   - `compute_type`: "CPU" or "GPU"
   - `compute_details`: Detailed hardware information

3. **Processing Logs** - Added compute environment logging:
   ```
   üñ•Ô∏è Compute: CPU (8 cores, 8 threads)
   ```

### Frontend Changes
1. **CompactJobsTable.js** - Added compute column with visual indicators
2. **App.js** - Added current compute mode to executive dashboard
3. **Icons and Styling** - CPU chip and rocket launch icons for visual distinction

## Usage for Performance Comparison

### Comparing Results
When you have both GPU and CPU results, you can easily compare:

1. **Processing Speed**: Compare total processing times between GPU and CPU jobs
2. **Throughput**: Words per second and pages per second metrics
3. **Scalability**: How performance changes with document size/complexity
4. **Consistency**: Variance in processing times between compute types

### Example Comparison
```
Document: research_paper.pdf (57 pages)

CPU Processing:
- Compute: Intel i7-9700K (8 cores, 8 threads)
- Time: 100.3s
- Throughput: 2,279 words/sec
- Pages/sec: 0.57

GPU Processing (when available):
- Compute: NVIDIA RTX 3080 (1 device)
- Time: 45.2s
- Throughput: 5,065 words/sec  
- Pages/sec: 1.26

Performance Improvement: 2.2x faster with GPU
```

### Metrics to Compare
- **Total Processing Time**: Overall job completion time
- **Words per Second**: Text processing throughput
- **Pages per Second**: Document processing rate
- **Memory Usage**: Resource efficiency (when available)
- **Consistency**: Processing time variance across similar documents

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Optimization Guidance**: Identify which processing stages benefit most from GPU acceleration
