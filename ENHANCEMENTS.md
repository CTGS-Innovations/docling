Got it — you’re not asking me to design it just for bills, safety, or finance. You want a **methodology** that lets you look at a **large, mixed corpus (1,000 docs)**, figure out what domains/keywords/entities matter, and then build extraction rules/schemas around that.

Here’s a framework you can follow step by step.

# Methodology for Domain Keyword Analysis → Fact Extraction Design

## 1. Normalize and Chunk the Corpus

* **Goal:** Standardize the input so comparisons are possible.
* Steps:

  1. Convert all docs (PDF, HTML, DOCX, TXT) into plain text.
  2. Break long docs into chunks (e.g., 200–500 tokens, or logical page/section units).
  3. Store them with metadata (source, time, type, file hash).

👉 Output: a chunk-level dataset you can analyze consistently.

---

## 2. Build Baseline Statistics

Run lightweight text analytics across all chunks to get a **bird’s-eye view**.

* Word counts, average sentence length.
* Term frequency (TF) and unique term counts.
* Bigram/trigram counts (common phrases).
* Keyword-in-context (KWIC) for terms like “report,” “cost,” “requires.”

👉 This gives you a **vocabulary map** of the corpus.

---

## 3. Identify Domain Signals

Cluster or classify documents based on **keywords + entities**.

* **Techniques:**

  * Keyword frequency by doc → cluster into topics.
  * Named Entity Recognition (NER) → pull out organizations, people, dates, money, locations.
  * Dictionary matches (gazetteers) for known agencies, industries, financial terms.
* **Outcome:** Each doc gets a **domain fingerprint** (e.g., 40% finance, 30% safety, 20% general).

👉 This is your **pretag layer** (like the YAML example you showed).

---

## 4. Map Nouns to Entity Categories

Take the most frequent nouns and noun phrases, then decide: are these **entities** you care about?

* Use POS tagging to pull out nouns.
* Filter by frequency and context.
* Examples:

  * “OSHA”, “falls”, “training hours” → Safety domain entities.
  * “EBITDA”, “revenue”, “quarter” → Finance domain entities.
  * “H.R. 1234”, “Committee on Appropriations” → Government domain entities.

👉 Output: candidate entity types + alias dictionaries (gazetteers).

---

## 5. Map Verbs to Predicates

Do the same for verbs → these drive **relationships/facts**.

* Use POS tagging to pull out verbs.
* Rank verbs by frequency across domains.
* Example mappings:

  * Safety: “require” → `requires_training`, “cause” → `incident_cause`.
  * Finance: “reported” → `reported_revenue`, “announced” → `announced_loss`.
  * Government: “introduced” → `introduced_on`, “appropriates” → `appropriates_to`.

👉 Output: verb→predicate mapping tables.

---

## 6. Build Domain-Specific Extraction Profiles

Combine the noun (entities) and verb (predicates) mappings into **profiles** for each domain.

* Each profile = gazetteers + regex rules + predicate maps.
* Example:

  * Safety profile: look for \[ORG/AGENCY] requires \[TRAINING\_HOURS].
  * Finance profile: \[ORG] reported \[AMOUNT] in \[PERIOD].
  * Government profile: \[BILL\_ID] appropriates \[MONEY] to \[ORG].

👉 These profiles are the **blueprints for fact extraction**.

---

## 7. Iterate with Candidate Facts

Run the profiles across the corpus → generate **candidate facts**.

* Expect noise at first.
* Evaluate: which rules produce high-precision facts vs which produce junk?
* Refine gazetteers (add aliases, remove false positives).
* Tighten regex patterns (require context words, not just numbers).

👉 This loop improves precision cheaply.

---

## 8. Prioritize by Coverage vs Cost

Some domains may only appear in a handful of docs. Others dominate.

* Measure: % of corpus covered by each profile.
* Focus:

  * **High-coverage domains** (e.g., safety, finance) → invest in detailed extraction rules.
  * **Low-coverage domains** → lightweight keyword tagging only.

👉 This keeps the pipeline cost-effective.

# Key Insights

1. **Pretagging saves money.** By classifying docs first, you only load relevant gazetteers and rules.
2. **Noun/verb mapping is universal.** Every domain has its own “entity nouns” and “relation verbs.” These should drive fact schema design.
3. **Profiles, not models.** Instead of one monolithic extractor, build **domain-specific profiles** that can be swapped in.
4. **Coverage vs precision tradeoff.** Regex + dictionaries = high precision, low coverage. NLP adds coverage but at CPU cost. Balance both.
5. **Start broad, refine narrow.** Begin with TF-IDF keywords + entity frequency, then drill down into fact-level patterns.
6. **Graphs unify facts.** Once extracted, facts from all domains can live in the same graph/relational schema (subject, predicate, object, value, provenance).

✅ This methodology lets you take a **1,000-doc mixed corpus**, map it into **domains → entities → predicates**, and then build **fact extractors** in a modular way, without expensive LLMs.

Would you like me to produce a **Markdown template for building a “Domain Profile”** (fields: domain name, top keywords, common entities, common verbs, regex rules, gazetteers, example fact JSON)? That way you could replicate this per domain.
