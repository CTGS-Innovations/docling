# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Enhanced Formula Detection in Docling

## 1. Executive Summary

**Problem Statement**: Docling's current formula detection system suffers from incomplete formula extraction, often detecting only partial formulas (left-hand side, right-hand side, or individual variables) instead of complete mathematical expressions. This occurs both for standalone formulas and formulas embedded within paragraphs.

**Solution**: Implement a multi-layered approach to improve formula detection accuracy through enhanced layout detection, intelligent region merging, and adaptive confidence thresholds.

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Architecture
- **Layout Detection**: Vision-based models (EGRET, HERON) identify formula regions
- **Formula Processing**: CodeFormula model (`ds4sd/CodeFormulaV2`) extracts LaTeX from detected regions
- **Confidence Threshold**: Fixed 0.5 threshold for formula detection
- **Two-Stage Process**: Layout detection â†’ Formula enrichment

### 2.2 Identified Issues
1. **Fragmented Detection**: Layout model splits complex formulas into multiple regions
2. **Incomplete Bounding Boxes**: Detected regions don't encompass full formulas
3. **Embedded Formula Problems**: Formulas within paragraphs aren't properly isolated
4. **Fixed Thresholds**: One-size-fits-all confidence settings don't adapt to document types
